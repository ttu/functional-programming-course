# History

In the __30s__:

* Alonzo Church defined __Lambda Calculus ƛ__
  * The theory behind functional programming
* Alan Turing defined __Turing Machine__
  * The theory that made imperative programming possible

???

In the olden times (2000's), FP / declarative was still concidered bad and C-like performance was the way to go...

TODO

_Imperative_ HOW to do it | loop for 20 -> pick one from array -> put to array
_Declarative_ WHAT to do (abstract away the details) | give  20 items to new array
_Functional_

# History

In the __50s__ practical implementations of those theories

* John Backus, an IBM employee, created __FORTRAN__ 
  * One of the first "high level" imperative programming languages. 
* In the same years, John McCarthy created __Lisp__ in the MIT 
  * A practical implementation of Lambda Calculus theory.

#  What is functional programming?

Object-oriented programming (__OOP__) and Functional programming (__FP__) have the shared goal:

--

> __Create understandable, flexible programs that are free of bugs__

--

But they have different approaches for how to best create those programs.

---

#  Formal definition

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods

-- Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming


> Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

-- Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming


???

* OOP
  * Objects (contains data and methods)
* FP
  * Computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions 
  * Avoids changing-state and mutable data
---

# Functional vs Object-Oriented

In all programs, there are two primary components:

--

* __Data__ (the stuff a program knows) 
* __Behaviors__ (the stuff a program can do to/with that data).

---

# Functional vs Object-Oriented

__OOP__:
* Put data and its associated behavior together in a single location (_"object"_)
* Easier to understand how a program works

__FP__:
* Data and behavior are distinctively different things
* Should be kept separate for clarity

???

* Functional way is followed more nowadays
* __OOP__ says that bringing together data and its associated behavior in a single location (called an “object”) makes it easier to understand how a program works. 
* __FP__ says that data and behavior are distinctively different things and should be kept separate for clarity.

---

# When to use FP / OOP

> Whenever I write some code to deal with __data about people__ then __functional programming__ seems to work best

--

> Whenever I write some code to __simulate people__ then __object-oriented programming__ seems to work best

# When to use FP / OOP

* __OOP__ is about big picture
* __FP__ is about small picture

--


* FP - small composable functions
  * Make things simpler and easier to understand

--


* OOP - benefit in large apps
  * Benefit more subtle at the beginning

???

* Take benefit of the both worlds

* https://youtu.be/X_rxRMUGScA
* https://dev.to/martinhaeusler/comment/4251

---

# FP Pros / Cons

* Easier to understand
* No side effects
* Multithreading
* Strict rules how to code

--


* Hard to understand
* No abstraction
* Mutable state often needed at some point
  * Mutable state "outsourced" (Database, API, file)

???

* Elitism?
* In FP abstraction is just composing functions together
  * Makes complex code hard to understand

* What was this link?

  * This: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/1448a7c565801029b67a84848582c6e61822f572/src/createStore.js#L186 ?

# Functional language key features

* Type inference
* High order functions
* Pure functions
* Anonymous functions
* Lazy evaluation
* Pattern matching
* Immutability
* Tall call optimization
* Curry & Partial application
* Pipelining
* No null or void "types"
* Discriminated Union types
* Declarative

These features are pretty much same in all functional languages.

???

* How all this greatness can be achieved -> Good language features
* Most of functional features are used in OO languages
* F# has classes and methods from OO languages
* Declarative, rather than imperative
  * Performance not so great
  * Scientific / real world examples?
* FP is hard
  * Category theory etc.
* OOP is trying to be easy
* Functional languages are often used by advanced programmers
  * Therefore code has less bugs etc.

---


# FP vs OOP Reality

* Languages have evolved a lot

--


* Functional style is common
* Classic OOP not so much anymore

> "Modern" OO avoids inheritance and objects end up looking like functions/modules, where constructors are partial application.

--


* FP good for data handling
  * API's mostly handle data
  * Front ends mostly handle data

???

* Most functional examples are just functional style
* Or is classic OOP still common somewhere?
* Traditional OOP has not been common in ages
  * Data bundled all the time. Less things to keep track. E.g. Data-object has data and functionality. No one considers it as bad practice. Objects not bad
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKYCA3UsmrU&feature=youtu.be&t=4m50s
  * Sepearate Services and data
  * Legacy
     * Active Record (Rails): https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html
     * Anemic domain model was anti-pattern

---

# Common OOP nowadays (Modern OOP)

* Dumb value objects
  * All about data they encapsulate. Methods are constructors and some Hash-functions used for comparisons etc.
  * Records


--


* Stateless behaviour objects
  * Service classes
  * All state is passed in if needed ("dependency injection") 
  * "Pure"-functions

--


* Module objects
  * Grouping related functionality together

--

We're just using records and functions and modules and call them "objects" and "classes".

# F# Basics

F# Koans from GitHub:

https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans#functional-koans---f

---

## Type inference

Automatically detect types from the code

--

```fsharp
let add x y = 
  x + y
```

* __let__ keyword binds a name to value or function
* __let__ is always constant
* F# is typed language, 
  * The type inference algorithm gathers information from many sources to determine the types

--

Depending which line is first, type is either int or string.

```fsharp
let resultInt = add 2 3
// val resultInt : int = 5

let resultStr = add "2" "3"
// val resultStr : string = "23"
```

Both lines won't work at the same codebase.

---

## Type inference

Types can be defined manually and sometimes compiler asks types if algorithm can't determine it from the source.

```fsharp
let add (x:int)(y:int) : int = 
  x + y
```

--

Can define only some of the parameters

```fsharp
let add (x:string) y = 
  x + y
```

???

* NOTE: This will take just single tuple parameter
```fsharp
let add (x:int, y:int) : int = 
  x + y
```
---

## Pure functions

1. Given the same input, will always return the same output.

2. Produces no side effects.

![:scale 30%](./haskell_2x.png)

???

1. The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program’s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.

2. The function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests, input and output devices, or data mutation.

---

## Declarative

> _"What is wanted, not how to do it"_

--


* Imperative = How to do 
* Declarative = What is wanted to happen

Declarative is higher abstraction

--

```csharp
var items = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

// Imperative
var results = new List<int>();

foreach(var num in items)
{
  if (num % 2 == 0)
    results.Add(num);
}

// Declarative
var results = items.Where(num => num % 2 == 0);
```

---

## Currying

1. A curried function is a function which takes multiple parameters one at a time, by taking the first argument, and returning a series of functions which each take the next argument until all the parameters have been fixed, and the function application can complete, at which point, the resulting value is returned

--

In functional languages functions are automatically curried. 

No need to provide all arguments when calling a function.

--

```fsharp
let add x y = x + y
let addFive = add 5

let result = addFive 9

// val add : x:int -> y:int -> int
// val addFive : (int -> int)
// val result : int = 14
```

---

## Partial Application

1. Providing function with fewer arguments than it expects is called Partial Application of functions

2. Returns a function with fewer parameters

--

```fsharp
let combine x y z = x + y + z
let combineT = combine "T" 
let res = combineT "H" "E"

// val combine : x:string -> y:string -> z:string -> string
// val combineT : (string -> string -> string)
// val res : string = "THE"
```

???

Difference?
Simple answer. 
Currying: Providing one argument per-call. 
Partial Application: Providing multiple arguments per-call

---

## High order functions

1. Take other functions as parameters
2. Return functions as result

--

```fsharp
let addFive x f = 
  f x + 5

let double x =
  x * 2

let result = addFive 2 double

// val addFive : x:'a -> f:('a -> int) -> int
// val double : x:int -> int
// val result : int = 9
```

TODO: Better example
---

## Immutability

Can't change value after it is created

Literally means "unchanging over time"

```fsharp
let result = 2
// Won't do anything
result = 4
// Won't compile
result <- 4
```

--

Often languages have a way to define mutable values

```fsharp
let mutable result = 2
result <- 4
```

--

* Javascript: const & let
* Scala / Kotlin: val & var
* C#: all are mutable

> _NOTE: Don't mix constant with real immutable. With constants variable cannot be re-assigned, nor re-declared, but object's properties are still mutable._

---

## Example: How to count things without mutable variables?

Traditional for loop

```csharp
var numbers = new []{ 1, 2, 3 };

var sum = 0;

for(int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
{
    sum += numbers[i];
}
```

---

## Solution: Recursion

```csharp
var numbers = new []{ 1, 2, 3 };

var sum = Calculate(0, numbers);

int Calculate(int seed, IEnumerable<int> numbers)
{
    if (numbers.Any() == false)
        return seed;

    return Calculate(seed + numbers.First(), numbers.Skip(1));
}
```

--

Recursion with F#

```fsharp
let numbers = [1; 2; 3]

let rec calculate seed items =
  match items with
  | head::tail -> calculate (seed + head) tail
  | _ -> seed

let result = calculate 0 numbers
```

* _Hint:_ recursion is almost always a solution to your problem

---

## Solution: Modern Libraries

C# and LINQ

```csharp
var numbers = new []{ 1, 2, 3 };

// Use reduce (Aggregate in C#)
var sum = numbers.Aggregate(0, (total, current) => total + current);

// Or just Sum-function
var sum2 = numbers.Sum();
```

--

F#

```fsharp
let numbers = [1; 2; 3]

let sum = Seq.reduce (fun x y -> x + y) numbers
let sum2 = Seq.sum numbers

// val numbers : int list = [1; 2; 3]
// val sum : int = 6
// val sum2 : int = 6
```

---

## Recursion, Tail Call Optimization & Tail Recursion

_Tail call optimization_ optimizes recursive functions to _tail recursive_ functions

--

_A tail recursion_ is a recursive function where the function calls itself at the end (_"tail"_) of the function

--

Optimization is done __automatically__ by the compiler

--

Often talked topic with functional languages -> must be a good thing (or is it?)

--

<br/>

#### Tail Recursion Call Stack

* Normal call allocates a stack frame for each call

--

* With tail recursion call reuses the current stack frame

--

> __ -> No stack overflows__

???

* Show this example before tail recursion:
  * https://github.com/ttu/patterns-and-principles/blob/master/PatternsAndPrinciples/Patterns/Other/OOP_to_functions.cs
  * Main loop with recursion
* Call at the end must be a function
* Many compilers optimize to change a recursive call to a tail recursive or an iterative call
* Must be a good thing (or is it?)
* Meaning a tail-recursive function will only use a single stack frame as opposed to hundreds or even thousands

---

## Tail Recursion

The compiler is simply able to transform this

```csharp
int fac_times(int n, int acc) {
  if (n == 0) 
    return acc;
  else 
    return fac_times(n - 1, acc * n);
}
```

into something like this:

--

```csharp
int fac_times(int n, int acc) {
label:
    if (n == 0) return acc;
    acc *= n--;
    goto label;
}
```

If the compiler cannot reduce recursion to a loop, you are stuck with recursion. All or nothing.

---

## Tail Recursion Stack Trace Example

e.g. sum(5) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15

--

#### Recursive

As last call is not a function, tail call optimization can't be done

```js
function sum(x) {
  if (x===1) {
      return x;
  } else {
      return x + sum(x-1);
  }
}
```

--

Stacktrace

```sh
1> sum(5)
2> 5 + sum(4)
3> 5 + (4 + sum(3))
4> 5 + (4 + (3 + sum(2)))
5> 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + sum(1))))
6> 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + 1)))
15
```

???

* Compiler needs to execute every function, before it can starts the calculation

---

## Tail Recursion Stack Trace Example

#### Tail recursive

```js
function sum(x, running_total=0) {
  if (x===0) {
      return running_total;
  } else {
      return sum(x-1, running_total+x);
  }
}
```

--

Stacktrace

```sh
1> sum(5, 0)
1> sum(4, 5)
1> sum(3, 9)
1> sum(2, 12)
1> sum(1, 14)
1> sum(0, 15)
15
```

???

* Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/37010

---

## Tail Recursion Example

__NOTE:__ _C# Compiler_ doesn't always do _tail call_ optimiazation. Example code has manually added `goto` and `label`.

```csharp
// Compiler could optimize this
private int RecSum(int x, int runningTotal = 0)
{
	if (x == 0)
		return runningTotal;
	else
		return RecSum(x - 1, runningTotal + x);
}

private int TailRecSum(int x, int runningTotal = 0)
{
	TailRecursion:
	if (x == 1)
		return runningTotal;
    runningTotal += x--;
	goto TailRecursion;
}
```

---

## Tail Recursion - Why?

#### Stack overflow

Functional languages highly rely on recursion

Tail call optimization is essential in functional languages

Without tail recursion, long-running recursive functions would exhaust the call stack and fail due to stack overflow exceptions

--

#### Performance

Normal recursive methods are really abusive to the call stack
  * Each call creates a new stack frame for the context of the new method (arguments, local variables, etc.)

Tail recursion replaces the current stack frame

---

## Tail Recursion - Why not needed?

Sometimes tailcall is a performance win-win

Sometimes tailcall is a performance loss, stack win

--

Tail call will eliminate stack trace and recursion won't show as a recursion

--

Recursion should not be a day to day tool to solve all problems

--

<br/>

> _I don't believe in recursion as the basis of all programming. This is a fundamental belief of certain computer scientists, especially those who love Scheme and like to teach programming by starting with a "cons" cell and recursion._ 

> _But to me, seeing recursion as the basis of everything else is just a nice theoretical approach to fundamental mathematics (turtles all the way down), not a day-to-day tool._

_Guido Van Rossum_

???

* CLR is a complex machine
* https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/1235#issuecomment-406770344
* http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html
* Although everyone talks highly about it, it might not be needed

---

## Tail Recursion - Why not needed?

Recursion is not the most common solutions in imperative languages, so Tail Call optimization is not always needed

Maybe some other feature is more important?

--

Java used to have security features that relied on stack count

> _"in JDK classes [...] there are a number of security sensitive methods that rely on counting stack frames between JDK library code and calling code to figure out who's calling them."_

> [Brian Goetz (Java Language Architect at Oracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y5Pv4yN0b0&t=1h02m18s)

--

Features are not free to implement, so if not needed don't do it

> _"Features aren't cheap; they are extremely expensive and they must not only justify their own cost, they must justify the opportunity cost of not doing the hundred other features we could have done with that budget."_

> [Eric Lippert](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4914207/1272233)

---

## Pipelining

Method chaining, where output of one element is the input of the next one

```fsharp
let add x y = x + y
let square x = x * x
let toString x = x.ToString()

let completeFunction x = toString(add 5 (square x))

let completeFunction x = x |> square |> add 5 |> toString
```


???

* TODO: Get All data, get only some, do some other
* Pipelining coming also to Javascript
* Extremely useful with data handling
* LINQ is similar

---

## Composing

```fsharp
let add2 a = a + 2
let multiply3 a = a * 3

let calculation = add2 >> multiply3
let result = calculation 3

// val add2 : a:int -> int
// val multiply3 : a:int -> int
// val calculation : (int -> int)
// val result : int = 15
```

--

Direction can be both ways

```fsharp
let calculation = add2 << multiply3
let result = calculation 3 
// val result : int = 11
```

???

* Compose returns a function instead of immediately invoking the sequence.
* https://stackoverflow.com/a/10096444/1292530
---

## Composing 

Example with multiple arguments

```fsharp
let add a b = a + b
let multiply a b = a * b

let calculate = add 2 >> multiply 3

let result = calculate 2
val add : a:int -> b:int -> int
val multiply : a:int -> b:int -> int
val calculate : (int -> int)
val result : int = 12
```

---

## Composing

https://suave.io/restful.html

```fsharp
let app =
  GET >=> path "/test"
  >=> OK (UTF8.bytes it)
  >=> setMimeType "application/json; charset=utf-8"
```

`>=>` Kleisli composition operator for monads


--

* `>=>` is just a function composition
* `>>` wouldn't work here since the return type of the first function isn't the argument of the second one
  * it is wrapped in a Result<'t> and needs to be unwrapped, which is exactly what >=> implementation does.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30110964/what-f-sorcery-is-this

???

* F# / Functional languages have lot's of weird functionality
---

## No void "type"

The unit type is a special type that represents the lack of a value

```fsharp
let sendData data =
  //...sending the data to the server...
  ()

sendData "help"

// val sendData : data:'a -> unit
// val it : unit = ()
```

???

No nulls / undefines is also a common feature in other languages
NullReferenceException

---

## Discriminated Unions

Discriminated unions are like Enums on steroids

```fsharp
type Condiment =
    | Mustard
    | Ketchup
    | Relish
    | Vinegar

type Favorite =
    | Bourbon of string
    | Number of int

type Shape =
    | Rectangle of width : float * length : float
    | Circle of radius : float
    | Line of length: float
```

--

```fsharp
let myFav = Bourbon "Jack Daniel's"
let myFav2 = Number 3
let myRectangle = Rectangle (2.0, 3.0)
// val myFav : Favorite = Bourbon "Jack Daniel's"
// val myFav2 : Favorite = Number 3
// val myRectangle : Shape = Rectangle (2.0,3.0)
```

???

* TODO: Example
* No need to have complex types/classes as these can represent complex types easily

---

## No null / Maybe types

Maybe types are used to represent calculations that may or may not return a value. 

--

F# has Option type

```fsharp
type Option<'a> =
   | Some of 'a
   | None
```

--

```fsharp
let someValue = Some 10
let noValue = None

let someIsSome = someValue.IsSome
let someIsNone = someValue.IsNone
let some = someValue.Value
let noIsSome = noValue.IsSome

// val someValue : int option = Some 10
// val noValue : 'a option
// val someIsSome : bool = true
// val someIsNone : bool = false
// val some : int = 10
// val noIsSome : bool = false
```

---

## Option

There is still null and NullReferenceException

```fsharp
let noValue = None
let exception = noValue.Value
```

--

Pattern matching is the way to get the value

```fsharp
let someValue = Some 10

let getValue x = 
    match x with
        | Some x -> x
        | None -> 0

let result = getValue someValue
```

--

Ternerary like operation is also possible

```fsharp
let someValue = Some 10
let result = if someValue.IsSome then someValue.Value else -1
```

???

* Why imperative languages don't have Maybe-type? Not a solution for everything.

---

## Option and Pattern Matching

Power of Option is in pattern matching and Option-functions

```fsharp
let getStars stars =
  match stars with
  | 3 -> "***"
  | 2 -> "**"
  | 1 -> "*"
  | _ -> "Invalid rating"

let getText rating =
  match rating with
  | Some stars -> getStars stars
  | None -> "Not rated"

let rating = Some 3
let text = getText rating
let rating2 = None
let text2 = getText rating2

// val getStars : stars:int -> string
// val getText : rating:int option -> string
// val rating : int option = Some 3
// val text : string = "***"
// val rating2 : 'a option
// val text2 : string = "Not rated"
```

???

* getStart matches with any int
* getText matches with Option Some/None
---

## Some and Option-functions

The option module also includes functions that correspond to the functions that are available for lists, arrays, sequences, and other collection types.

```fsharp
let decideOn rating =
    rating
    |> Option.map (fun stars -> if stars > 2 then "watch it" else "don't watch")

let rating = Some 3
let decision = decideOn rating
let rating2 = Some 1
let decision2 = decideOn rating2
let rating3 = None
let decision3 = decideOn rating3

// val decideOn : rating:int option -> string option
// val rating : int option = Some 3
// val decision : string option = Some "watch it"
// val rating2 : int option = Some 1
// val decision2 : string option = Some "don't watch"
// val rating3 : 'a option
// val decision3 : string option = None
```

# Monads

> _A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors_

...

--

### Problem

1. Monad is a hard thing to understand and after you do, you still can't explain it easily

> _“Once you understand monads, you immediately become incapable of explaining them to anyone else” Lady Monadgreen’s curse ~ Gilad Bracha_

---

# Monads


* Monads are not data structures or a particular function

--


* Monads are a design pattern for expressing sequential computation in a purely functional way with constraints on side effects

--

![:scale 80%](./di_monad_comic.jpg)

https://twitter.com/hmemcpy/status/771359835514368000

---

# Monads

### Reality 

1. Pure functional languages like Haskell use this Monads to isolate impurity (side effects). 
1. Any function that talks to the outside world will return an IO Monad.
1. Real Monads require full support from the language
1. Concept is widly talked although not that important

???

* Haskelö is at the moment the ultimate-language and it has the concept of monad so all cool languages should also have
---

# Monads

### Solution

1. Forget whole monad thing as you don't actually need this information on anything

__Very simple definition:__

Monad is a container, that has a value inside and it will be evaluated after all the attached operations are executed

???
Althoug some articles just use monad and expect you to know what it is

Very simple definition is not correct, but close enough

# Functor, Applicative & Monad

__Functors:__ you apply a function to a wrapped value using __map__

__Applicatives:__ you apply a wrapped function to a wrapped value using __apply__

__Monads:__ you apply a function that returns a wrapped value, to a wrapped value using __flatMap__

![:scale 80%](./monads.png)

???

* Before monads, need to understand functors and applicatives
* Applicative and Monad are already so close together, so showing the difference might be hard

Examples:

# Normal Function

![:scale 80%](./monads_normalfunction.png)

You can apply function to value

```fsharp
let number = 2;
let funAddThree x = x + 3;

let result = funAddThree number
```

???
---

# Context

![:scale 20%](./monads_context.png)

* Context is an important part of monads
* Any value can be in a context

```fsharp
let twoInContext = Some 2
```
--

> __Think context as a box that you can put a value in__

---

# Context

Maybe (_Just|None_) from Haskell

![:scale 20%](./monads_maybe.png)

--

Option (_Some|None_) from F#
```fsharp
let myValue = Some 2
// val myValue : int option = Some 2

let myValue = None
// val myValue : 'a option
```

---

# Context

Problem. When a value is wrapped in a context, you can’t apply a normal function to it.

![:scale 20%](./monads_functioncontext.png)

```fsharp
let someValue = Some 10
let addThree x = x + 3

// Error
let result = addThree someValue
```

---

# Solution: Functors

Functors apply a function to a wrapped value

![:scale 80%](./monads_functor.png)

---

# Functors

![:scale 80%](./monads_functorunwrap.png)

```fsharp
// A Functor is any type that defines how map applies to it
// And map magically applies this function, because Option is a Functor
let wrapperValue  = Some 10
let mapAddTwo = Option.map (fun x -> x + 2)
let mapResult = wrapperValue |> mapAddTwo

// val myValue : int option = Some 10
// val mapTwo : (int option -> int option)
// val mapResult : int option = Some 12
```
---

# Functors

List is also a Functor

F#:
```fsharp
// A Functor is any type that defines how map applies to it
// And map magically applies this function, because List is a Functor
let numbers = [1; 2; 3]
let myMap = List.map (fun x -> x + 1) 
let result = numbers |> myMap

// val numbers : int list = [1; 2; 3]
// val myMap : (int list -> int list)
// val result : int list = [2; 3; 4]
```

C#:
```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
var result = numbers.Select(e => e + 1);
// val result = { 2, 3, 4 }
```

???

* Promise is a functor. Promise's map is then
* Task is a functor. Taks's map is ContinueWith

# Applicatives

Applicative has the function and the value wrapped in context.

![:scale 80%](./monads_applicative.png)

Use built in function Option.bind to deal with applicatives
```fsharp
let wrapperValue = Some 2
let myFunc x = Some (x + 3)

let result = Option.bind myFunc wrapperValue

// val wrapperValue : int option = Some 2
// val myFunc : x:int -> int option
// val result : int option = Some 5
```

---

# Applicatives

If function is None will return None

![:scale 80%](./monads_applicativenone.png)

```fsharp
let wrapperValue = None
let myFunc x = Some (x + 3)

let result = Option.bind myFunc wrapperValue

// val wrapperValue : 'a option
// val myFunc : x:int -> int option
// val result : int option = None
```

---

# Applicatives

If _map_ function would be used, value would be packed inside 2 context
```fsharp
let wrapperValue = Some 2
let myFunc x = Some (x + 3)

let result = Option.map myFunc wrapperValue

// val wrapperValue : int option = Some 2
// val myFunc : x:int -> int option
// val result : int option option = Some (Some 5)
```

__Remember that these require native support from the language__

We will skip C# example because it would require customer method for _bind/apply_
---

# Monads

> Monads are just applicative functors with join added to the interface

Kind of like LINQ.

1. Take list values
2. Do some functions
3. Get Queryable

# F# Type Providers

> An F# type provider is a component that provides types, properties, and methods for use in your program. 

--

> Automatically creates types models from external data sources: e.g. Databases, APIs (Swagger), Excel, etc.

# API with Functional languages

__Suave__ is F# Web Framework

https://suave.io

Example project:

# Mixing F# and C#

* Possible to reference F# projects from C# projects
* Can't use F# files in C# projects

???

* F# and C# have own compilers

# Clojure

Clojure is a Lisp, so it has different syntax than most "normal" looking languages

```clj
(def hello "hello world!")
(defn  callPrint [x y] (println x y))
(callPrint hello "by: James")

;; hello world! by: James
```

### Problems

* In the beginnign functional API's are a thing of beauty
* After a while real world requirements ruin everything
 * Function for handling the endpoint is not just few lines of code

???

* TODO: Show real world problems with Spring 5 API
---

## C# API example

_ASP.NET Core_ example of routing without _Controller_-classes.

```cs
var routeBuilder = new RouteBuilder(app);

routeBuilder.MapGet("", (context) => Endpoints.Hello(context));
routeBuilder.MapGet("api/time", (context) => Endpoints.Time(context));
routeBuilder.MapGet("api/values/{id:int}", (context) => Endpoints.Values(context));
routeBuilder.MapGet("api/name/{name?}", (context) => Endpoints.Name(context));
routeBuilder.MapPost("api/auth", context => Endpoints.Auth(context));

var routes = routeBuilder.Build();
app.UseRouter(routes);
```

Functionality moved to another file (_Endpoints_), to make API definition clean.

# Clojure vs F-sharp

```clj
(def numbers-in-string (str "37900490610897696126265185408732594047834333441947")

(apply max(map #(reduce * %) (partition 5 1 (map #(Character/getNumericValue %) numbers-in-string))))

;; Littlebit readable syntax

(->> numbers-in-string
     (map #(Character/getNumericValue %))
     (partition 5 1)
     (map #(reduce * %))
     (apply max))
```

```fsharp
let numbersInString = "37900490610897696126265185408732594047834333441947"

numbersInString
 |> Seq.toList
 |> List.map System.Char.GetNumericValue
 |> List.windowed 5
 |> List.map (List.reduce (fun acc elem -> acc * elem))
 |> List.max
 ```

---

# F-sharp vs C-sharp

```fsharp
let numbersInString = "37900490610897696126265185408732594047834333441947"

numbersInString
 |> Seq.toList
 |> List.map System.Char.GetNumericValue
 |> List.windowed 5
 |> List.map (List.reduce (fun acc elem -> acc * elem))
 |> List.max
 ```

C# implementation is not as pretty, especially as LINQ doesn't have partition function.

```csharp
var numbersInString = "37900490610897696126265185408732594047834333441947";

var ints = numbersInString.ToCharArray()
                          .Select(c => (int)Char.GetNumericValue(c));
				
ints.Select((item, index) =>  new { I = item, Idx = index })
    .Select(i => ints.Skip(i.Idx).Take(5))
    .Select(i => i.Aggregate((acc, elem) => acc * elem))
    .Max();
```

# Things to take from FP to OOP

* Only readonly variables in classes
  * Easier to follow logic when object's internal state can't change
* Keep data and functions separate
  * E.g. separate models and services
  * This used to be a bad thing
* Functions are parameters (HOF)
  * Pass actions, funcs etc. to methods
  * Often inheritance is not needed
* Important to understand when to pass reference types and when just plain values
  * Immutable sometimes good
* Use functional style libraries e.g. LINQ

---

# Summary

The problem with a completely new programming paradigm isn’t learning a new languag, as language syntax is merely details. The tricky part is learning to __think in a different way__. 

OO and Functional languages getting closer to each other.
